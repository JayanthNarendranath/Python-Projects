  This Web Scraping proposal dwells on the introduction and motivation for the chosen topic.
The kind of findings on which the focus will be on. The approach taken to gather the data for
analysis.

  The domain is retail from the Hudson Bay Company, specifically watch collections.
Watches collections are always fascinating to window shop. The fascination grew higher as the
engineering graduation day was nearing, which requires a good watch that suits well with a formal
suit. The Hudson Bay website has huge collections of watches with the necessary details that
make gathering business statistics easy. The interesting things that can be scraped from the
project are: which brands have more stocks? Which brands have high ratings? What are the
average discounts for each brand? How many stocks are there for each color? Which
gender has the biggest discount? The findings can help determine a good watch based on a budget.
The potential approach to scrap the website is first to get the data, then clean the data, and finally
analyze the data. The data can be collected from the website’s URL by programming it to
automatically scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the “Load more” button to get data
from multiple pages. The gathered data can be cleaned to remove the extra strings, converted to
the desired datatypes for calculation purposes, and used data frames to make the data look well
classified with rows and columns. Lastly, import libraries such as pandas and matplotlib to
illustrate the data in the form of graphs to conclude.

  The Hudson Bay Company watch collections are analyzed to find top watches for graduation
day. Interesting findings are gathered based on different categories such as gender, brand, price,
discounted price, and discount percentage. The approach was to get the data from the website
and apply Python libraries to plot graphs for analysis.
